## Create and publish course
3. The application allows users with the instructor role to create courses. The instructor must enter the following information to create a course:
- Course name.
- Description
- Category
- Price
- Course evaluation (This is not entered by the Instructor, it has to be taken from evaluations made by students).
- Videos: The system must allow the uploading of videos.
- Images: The system must allow the uploading of images.
- Content: The system must allow the uploading of contents.
- Files: The system must allow the uploading of files (PDF, DOC, XML).

4. The course has two states active and inactive. The instructor can activate it. A course in active status is displayed in search results.
5. The instructor can edit a course, delete it as long as it is not active. If you want to modify or delete it, you must first deactivate it.

## Search and view courses
6. Users with the Student role have the possibility to search for courses using different types of filters:
- Course name.
- Category
- Price range

7. The search result should show the courses that match the user's search.

## Promotion Course
8. The system will have a feature called Promotion Course. The promotion consists in that the oldest and active course in the system enters in promotion for possible students. The promotion consists in that the user who accesses to the course first will get a 50% discount. The system must give the user a maximum of 10 minutes to enroll in. If this time passes, the course is released and another student can access it. For this specific feature, you must use concurrent programming. The Promotion Course option can only be activated by the administrator.
